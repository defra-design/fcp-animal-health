      <p class="govuk-body">This service forms part of the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway. It will provide payments to livestock keepers to fund farm visits by vets.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To get funding, you must have an Improve Animal Health and Welfare (IAHW) agreement in place for any reviews or follow-ups.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can get funding for a vet, or a team chosen by a vet, to visit your farm if you keep:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>beef cattle</li>
          <li>dairy cattle</li>
          <li>pigs</li>
          <li>sheep</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">A vet, or a team chosen by a vet, can do these visits. If a farmer is a vet, they must use another vet and should not do the visit themselves.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are 2 parts to the service:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>animal health and welfare review</li>
          <li>endemic disease follow-up</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can choose the vet you want to do these. If the farmer is a vet, they must use another vet and should not do the visit themselves. The review and follow-up are not an inspection or audit.</p>
